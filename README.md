# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 1 January 2018 (AngularJS)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed issues with the filters in my angularJS app.

**Thoughts:** I was told not to learn angularJS but for the sake of a job, I'm learning angularJS. plus it is version 1! but honestly angularJS is much more easier than reactJS. Today done all the CRUD functions in angularJS. 

I used [reload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reload) as my localhost server. it automatically reloads the webpage when i save my codes. Very useful!

### Day 2: 2 January 2018 (AngularJS)

**Today's Progress**: Learn a new technique using UI-Router.

**Thoughts:** Had many problems making the ui-router works. Turns out that the name has changed and the tutorial was using an outdated plugin. Initially was angular-ui-router, now its @uirouter. Lots of troubleshooting and forgot to add the stateProvider!
